Introduction

In the realm of modern finance, the timely repayment of loans is of paramount importance for 
both lenders and borrowers. The core focus of our project revolves around the predictive 
analysis of loan approval based on an applicant's repayment history. By leveraging cutting edge 
data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to create a robust model that can 
assess an applicant's likelihood of paying their loans on time. This model will enable lending 
institutions to make more informed decisions regarding loan approvals, thereby reducing risks 
and enhancing the overall lending experience.


Data Set Information

Our dataset contains 307,511 observations, which means that we have data on over 300,000 
loan applicants. Each applicant is represented by 122 different pieces of information, such as 
their gender, income, education status, and employment status.

SMART Questions
1. Which applicant characteristics and financial indicators exert the most significant 
influence on predicting loan approval decisions?
2. Are there any patterns in the repayment history of borrowers who default on their loans?
3. Can you identify any groups of borrowers who are at a higher risk of default?
4. How does the default rate vary by borrower employment status?
5. Can we develop predictive models to anticipate loan approval outcomes based on 
historical data and relevant applicant information?
6. What is the accuracy and reliability of these predictive models, and can they be 
effectively employed for future loan approval decisions and resource allocation within 
lending institutions?

Dataset Source

The â€œHome Credit Default Risk" dataset is a prominent data source available on Kaggle, a 
popular online platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. Kaggle hosts a wide 
range of datasets and competitions, including this one, which focuses on predicting the 
presence of malware in software based on various features and characteristics.
