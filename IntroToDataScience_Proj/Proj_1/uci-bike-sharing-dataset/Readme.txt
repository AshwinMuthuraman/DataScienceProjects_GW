					Bike Share Chronicles: Unveiling Patterns
					==========================================


=========================================
Background 
=========================================

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back at another position. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, 
environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by
these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration
of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into
a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important
events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

=========================================
Data Set Information
=========================================

This dataset consists around 17,000 records, offering comprehensive details about the rental activity of 
bikes on both an hourly and daily basis throughout the years 2011 and 2012 within the Capital Bikeshare 
system. Furthermore, it encompasses relevant data concerning the prevailing weather conditions and 
the specific seasons that characterized this time frame

=========================================
SMART Questions
=========================================


1. How does weather (e.g., temperature, precipitation, wind speed) affect bike sharing usage?
2. Does the impact of weather on bike sharing usage vary by type of user (casual vs. registered)?
3. Is there a significant difference in bike rentals on holidays compared to regular days?
4. Is there evidence of any outliers or anomalies in the data that could explain extreme rental 
activity?
5. Do certain hours of the day show higher rental activity, and if so, why?
6. Can we achieve a better understanding of customer preferences by analyzing bike rental 
patterns based on user types (registered vs. casual)?
7. What is the average number of bike rentals per hour during peak commuting hours (e.g., 7 AM 
- 9 AM and 4 PM - 6 PM)?
8. Is there a measurable difference in bike rental counts between registered and casual users?
9. Can we build predictive models to forecast bike rental demand based on historical data and 
relevant features?
10. Which features are the most influential in predicting bike rental counts?
11. How accurate are these predictive models, and can they be used for future planning or resource 
allocation?
